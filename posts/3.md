- New requirement: batches of 5k operations noticeably lagging. Needs to take < 1 sec
- Write a benchmark class
    - First, measure 5k deposits with a `bench.rb` script
    - Then, measure log writes vs data updates w/in deposit operation
    - Then, measure balance calcs vs in-memory updates vs disk writes

- Observe that disk writes updating data are the hotspot
- WAL is our source of truth for recovery, what if we relaxed our Immediate persistence strategy and recover missing disk writes using the log?

- Write `Persistence::Buffered` strategy. Set threshold to one to match immediate strategy for benchmarking

- Calculate threshold to meet our requirements (see math below)

- Tweak threshold and observe

- Big ideas: Buffering and the Memory Hierarchy

- TODO: Introduce `flush` on persistence strategies
- TODO: Call flush after modify block on Buffer.recover so that we capture recovery changes
- TODO: Introduce a `Bank#shutdown` method to flush the buffer

- We've introduced a bug: what if there's a crash before the buffer is flushed? WAL without persistence
- Next up: Implement REDO during system recovery

Time = calc + logging + data

We want to process 5000 writes in 1,000,000 us (1 sec)

1000000 us = 5775 us + 481343 us + data

512882 us = data <-- upper bound for data writes

5000 * 1.5 us = 7500 us <-- how long in-memory updates will take

512882 us available - 7500 us taken by in-memory updates = 505,382 us remaining

505382 us remaining / 174 us per disk write

2904 disk writes possible

5000 ops / 2904 writes possible = need to write every 1.72 ops
